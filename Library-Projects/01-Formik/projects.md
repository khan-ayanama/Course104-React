# Formik Projects

## Beginner Projects

`Contact Form:` Create a simple contact form that includes name, email, and message fields. Use Formik to manage the form state and handle form submission, displaying a success message upon completion.

`Login Form:` Develop a login form with email and password fields. Integrate Formik for form management, including basic validation like required fields and email format.

`Registration Form:` Expand on the login form by adding more fields such as username, confirm password, and accept terms checkbox. Implement more advanced Formik validations, including password matching and checkbox required validation.

## Intermediate Projects

`Survey Form:` Design a survey form that includes different types of inputs like text, textarea, select dropdown, radio buttons, and checkboxes. Use Formik alongside Yup for schema-based form validation, exploring conditional validation and custom validation messages.

`Dynamic Form Fields:` Create a form that allows users to dynamically add or remove sections of the form (e.g., skills, work experiences). This project involves managing an array of form values and understanding how to manipulate them within Formik.

`Multi-step Form:` Implement a multi-step form wizard for a complex registration or checkout process. This will require managing the state across different steps, handling validation per step, and consolidating the final data on submission.

## Advanced Projects

`Formik with Third-party Integrations:` Integrate Formik with a UI library (like Material-UI, Ant Design, or Bootstrap) for styled components. Explore custom input components and how to integrate them seamlessly with Formik.

`Reusable Form Components:` Develop a library of reusable form components (e.g., input, select, radio group) that are integrated with Formik. Focus on creating a flexible API for the components that can handle various use cases and validation scenarios.

`Formik with Backend Integration:` Create a full-stack application where the front-end uses Formik for form management and the back-end handles data persistence (e.g., user registration form). This involves setting up an API to communicate between the front-end and back-end, handling server-side validation errors in Formik, and understanding asynchronous validation.

`Complex Form Patterns:` Tackle advanced form patterns such as dependent dropdowns (where the options in one dropdown depend on the selection made in another), file uploads with progress indicators, and integrating rich text editors. These require a deep understanding of Formik's capabilities and handling edge cases.
