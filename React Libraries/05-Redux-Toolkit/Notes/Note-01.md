# Redux Toolkit

## Installation

```bash
    npm i @reduxjs/toolkit
```

## Creating a Redux Store

```js
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {},
});
```

## Providing Store to react application

Once the store is created, we can make it available to our React components by putting a React-Redux `<Provider>` around our application in src/index.js. Import the Redux store we just created, put a `<Provider>` around your `<App>`, and pass the store as a prop:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";
import { store } from "./app/store";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

## Create a Redux State slice

Creating a slice requires a string name to identify the slice, an initial state value, and one or more reducer functions to define how the state can be updated. Once a slice is created, we can export the generated Redux action creators and the reducer function for the whole slice.

Redux requires that we write all state updates immutably, by making copies of data and updating the copies. However, Redux Toolkit's createSlice and createReducer APIs use Immer inside to allow us to write "mutating" update logic that becomes correct immutable updates.

```jsx
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const initialState = {
  value: 0,
};

export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers. It
      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,
      // which detects changes to a "draft state" and produces a brand new
      // immutable state based off those changes
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
      state.value += action.payload;
    },
  },
});

// Action creators are generated for each case reducer function
export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions;

export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

## Add slice to the store

```jsx
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "../features/counter/counterSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
});
```

## Use Redux state and Actions in Components

Now we can use the React-Redux hooks to let React components interact with the Redux store. We can read data from the store with useSelector, and dispatch actions using useDispatch. Create a src/features/counter/Counter.js file with a `<Counter>` component inside, then import that component into App.js and render it inside of `<App>`.

```js
import React from "react";
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { decrement, increment } from "./counterSlice";

export function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <button
          aria-label="Increment value"
          onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}
        >
          Increment
        </button>
        <span>{count}</span>
        <button
          aria-label="Decrement value"
          onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}
        >
          Decrement
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## RTK Query

## Create an API service

```js
// Need to use the React-specific entry point to import createApi
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from "@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react";

// Define a service using a base URL and expected endpoints
export const pokemonApi = createApi({
  reducerPath: "pokemonApi",
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/" }),
  endpoints: (builder) => ({
    getPokemonByName: builder.query({
      query: (name) => `pokemon/${name}`,
    }),
  }),
});

// Export hooks for usage in functional components, which are
// auto-generated based on the defined endpoints
export const { useGetPokemonByNameQuery } = pokemonApi;
```

## Add Service to store

An RTKQ service generates a "slice reducer" that should be included in the Redux root reducer, and a custom middleware that handles the data fetching. Both need to be added to the Redux store.

```js
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
// Or from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react'
import { setupListeners } from "@reduxjs/toolkit/query";
import { pokemonApi } from "./services/pokemon";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    // Add the generated reducer as a specific top-level slice
    [pokemonApi.reducerPath]: pokemonApi.reducer,
  },
  // Adding the api middleware enables caching, invalidation, polling,
  // and other useful features of `rtk-query`.
  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) =>
    getDefaultMiddleware().concat(pokemonApi.middleware),
});

// optional, but required for refetchOnFocus/refetchOnReconnect behaviors
// see `setupListeners` docs - takes an optional callback as the 2nd arg for customization
setupListeners(store.dispatch);
```
