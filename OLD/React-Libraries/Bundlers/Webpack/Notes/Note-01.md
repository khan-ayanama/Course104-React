# Introduction

Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph from one or more entry points and then combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles, which are static assets to serve your content from.

`Core concepts of webpack:`

## Entry

An entry point indicates which module webpack should use to begin building out its internal dependency graph. Webpack will figure out which other modules and libraries that entry point depends on (directly and indirectly).

By default its value is `./src/index.js`, but you can specify a different (or multiple) entry points by setting an entry property in the webpack configuration. For example:

```js
// webpack.config.js

module.exports = {
  entry: './path/to/my/entry/file.js',
};
```

## Output

The output property tells webpack where to emit the bundles it creates and how to name these files. It defaults to ./dist/main.js for the main output file and to the ./dist folder for any other generated file.

You can configure this part of the process by specifying an output field in your configuration:

```js
// webpack.config.js

const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './path/to/my/entry/file.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'my-first-webpack.bundle.js',
  },
};
```

## Loaders

Out of the box, webpack only understands JavaScript and JSON files. Loaders allow webpack to process other types of files and convert them into valid modules that can be consumed by your application and added to the dependency graph.

At a high level, loaders have two properties in your webpack configuration:

1. The test property identifies which file or files should be transformed.
2. The use property indicates which loader should be used to do the transforming.

```js
// webpack.config.js

const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  output: {
    filename: 'my-first-webpack.bundle.js',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [{ test: /\.txt$/, use: 'raw-loader' }],
  },
};

// The above code is telling: "Hey webpack compiler, when you come across a path that resolves to a '.txt' file inside of a require()/import statement, use the raw-loader to transform it before you add it to the bundle."
```

## Plugins

While loaders are used to transform certain types of modules, plugins can be leveraged to perform a wider range of tasks like bundle optimization, asset management and injection of environment variables.

In order to use a plugin, you need to require() it and add it to the plugins array. Most plugins are customizable through options. Since you can use a plugin multiple times in a configuration for different purposes, you need to create an instance of it by calling it with the new operator.

```js
// webpack.config.js

const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const webpack = require('webpack'); //to access built-in plugins

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [{ test: /\.txt$/, use: 'raw-loader' }],
  },
  plugins: [new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: './src/index.html' })],
};
```

## Mode

By setting the mode parameter to either development, production or none, you can enable webpack's built-in optimizations that correspond to each environment. The default value is production.

```js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'production',
};
```

## Browser Compatibility

Webpack supports all browsers that are ES5-compliant (IE8 and below are not supported). Webpack needs Promise for import() and require.ensure(). If you want to support older browsers, you will need to load a polyfill before using these expressions.
