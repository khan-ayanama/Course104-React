# Introduction

Babel is a JavaScript compiler

Used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.

Here are main things Babel can do for you:

- Transforms Syntax
- Pollyfill features that are missing in your target enivironment
- Source Code transformation

Polyfills change the source code to support older browser and codemods turn older code into latest versions of code

## Babel Packages

`@babel/core`: Main package to run any babel setup or configuration.
`@babel/cli`: Built-in CLI which can be used to compile files from the command line.
`@babel/preset-env`: This enables to use new and upcoming features which node.js is yet to understand. New features are always new and will probably take time to implement in Node.js by default.
`Installation`:

```bash
    npm install @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env
```

## Presets vs Plugins

Plugins are individual package for specific transformation while presets are the groups of plugins for the set of transformation

### @babel/preset-env

It enables to transpiled code for your specified target environment.

```json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "@babel/preset-env",
      {
        "targets": {
          "chrome": "58",
          "ie": "11"
        },
        "useBuiltIns": "usage",
        "corejs": 3,
        "modules": false
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

### useBuiltIns

It provides a way to handle the polyfills.

`entry`: It requires you to set polyfills manually.
`usage`: Babel automatically analyzes the polyfills needed.
`false`: It assumes you set the polyfills in your code.

We used @babel/cli to run Babel from the terminal, @babel/polyfill to polyfill all the new JavaScript features, and the env preset to only include the transformations and polyfills for the features that we use and that are missing in our target browsers.

## BABEL CLI

`Compile FIles:`

```bash
# comple single file
npx babel index.js

# Compile file and define output directory
# we can also use --out-file or -o
npx babel index.js --out-file index-compiled.js

# Compile everytime file changes
# We use --watch or -w
npx babel index.js --watch --out-file index-compiled.js
```

`Compile Directories:`

```bash
# Compile entire directory
# we can use either --out-dir or -d
# It doesn't overwrite compile-dir
npx babel src --out-dir compiled-dir

# Compile entire directory and output as single concatenated file
npx babel src --out-file index-compiled.js
```

## Setup Babel

- Install All required Babel packages

```bash
npm install @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env
```

- Create a file called .babelrc at the root directory of Project

```js
// .babelrc
{
    "presets":["@babel/preset-env"] // "@babel/env"
}
```

- Open package.json file

```json
// package.json
"scripts":{
    "build":"babel index.js --out-file prd/index.js",
    "start":"npm run buld && nodemon prd/index.js",
    "serve":"node prd/index.js"
}
```
